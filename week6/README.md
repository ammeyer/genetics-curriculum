Week 6: Next gen sequencing, alignment algorithms

### Tuesday, Nov 29  

- Next gen sequencing  
  + How was the first human genome sequenced?  
  + Shotgun vs "next gen"?  
  + Shotgun sequencing simulation  

### Thursday, Dec 1  

- Sequence alignment algorithms  
  + Naive exact match algorithm  
  + Inexact matching: Calculating pairwise distances  
  + Inexact matching algorithms (gap penalty)  
  + Really advanced: DP algorithms (Needleman-Wunsch)  
  + Why is sequence alignment hard? Discussion about time and space complexity
