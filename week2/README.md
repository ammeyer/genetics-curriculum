Week 2: The Central Dogma (Replication, Transcription, Translation), Mutation  

### Tuesday, Nov 1
- Short Icebreaker again (15 min)
- Python Review! Variables, Functions, Loops, Lists, Dictionaries, Strings (30 min)
- Discussion: What is DNA? Structure/Function? Nucleotides and complimentary bases (15 min)
- Python exercise: Pair programming. Complement a strand of DNA & count bases. (30 min)
- Discussion: What is transcription? What is translation? (15 min)
- Python exercise: Pair programming. Transcription and Translation (30 min)   

#### Python review
- Some warmup coding exercises (TBA)    

#### DNA coding exercise
- In pairs, fill in the functions `complement()` and `count_bases()` in `substitutions.py`.
- Create a test case for each other's functions (how to make a test case?) and make sure your functions are correct.
- Given the sample sequence provided, count the number of each base in the sequence and compare it to the number of each base in the complement. What do you notice, and why is this the case?  

#### Transcription and Translation coding exercise
- In pairs, fill in the functions `transcribe_dna()`, and `translate_rna()` in `substitutions.py`.
- Create a test case for each other's functions (how to make a test case?) and make sure your functions are correct.
- Test the functions using the beta globin gene sequences. Find the mutation. Does the resulting protein change?  
  

### Thursday, Nov 3
- Discussion: DNA Replication & Mutation
  + How does DNA replicate? (Bonus: How does a circular molecule of DNA replicate?) Is replication 100% accurate? What happens when it makes mistakes?
  + What is a mutation? What kinds of mutations are possible? What is the difference between a synonymous mutation and a nonsynonymous mutation?
  + Briefly touch on other types of mutations, insertions, deletions, inversions, large rearrangements, etc.  
- Mutation coding exercise
  
#### Mutation coding exercise
  + Fill in the functions `random_substitution()`, `is_synonymous()`, and `count_synonymous` in `substitutions.py`.  
  + Why don't all DNA mutations change the protein sequence?
