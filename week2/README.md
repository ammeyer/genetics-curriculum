Week 2: The Central Dogma (Replication, Transcription, Translation), Mutation  

### Tuesday, Nov 1
- Discussion: Gauge background knowledge on molecular bio
  + Draw out the process of DNA replication
  + Draw out the process of Transcription
  + Draw out the process of Translation
  + What is a mutation? Why do mutations occur? How do mutations relate to the above processes?  

- Python review
  + Some warmup coding exercises (TBA)  

- Transcription and Translation coding exercise (also review)
  + Fill in the functions `complement()`, `transcribe_dna()`, and `translate_rna()` in `substitutions.py`.
  + Test the functions using the beta globin gene sequences. Find the mutation. Does the resulting protein change?

### Thursday, Nov 3
- Discussion: More transcription, translation, replication, mutation
  + Talk about synonymous vs nonsynonymous substitutions
  + Talk about replication/mutation in the context of big picture evolution
  + Briefly touch on other types of mutations, insertions, deletions, inversions, large rearrangements, etc.
- Mutation coding exercise (hopefully only slightly more challenging than last class)
  + Fill in the functions `random_substitution()`, `is_synonymous()`, and `count_synonymous` in `substitutions.py`.
  + Why don't all DNA mutations change the protein sequence?
