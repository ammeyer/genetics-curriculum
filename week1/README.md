Week 1: Intros, Expectations, goals for the year, & evolution big picture stuff  

### Tuesday, Oct 25
- Intros again  
- Icebreaker  
- Expectations and goals for the year  
- Discussion: What is research?
- Lab tour!

#### Expectations and goals for the year
- Individual activity: On a piece of paper, I want you to write down a) one goal you have for these internships b) one academic goal (school or class related) and c) one personal goal you have for this school year. 
- Now until Dec: Reviewing biology, reviewing Python, learning computational biology techniques and bioinformatics. A lot of this involves ALGORITHMS. We will also work on getting the data and cleaning up the data in a way that we can start to analyze it by January
- Jan thru May: We will start work on the research project.  

##### Expectations:
  * Attendance: 3 excused and 3 unexcused. Email me beforehand. Share email/phone #
  * Check your email at least twice a week!
  * Treat each other with respect  

##### Goals: 
  * By the end of the year, you will all understand the motivation behind the research, what the main questions are and how the code you are writing helps address those questions.
  * You will be comfortable explaining what you did to an audience of both scientists (such as myself or Frank), as well as an audience of people with no science background.
  * You will understand how your programming skills can be applied to biology and to research.  


#### Discussion: What is research and how is it different from a class at school?  
- "Wet lab" vs "Dry lab"
- It is a process, can be slow at times, can change unexpectedly. FLEXIBILITY is so important.
- You WILL run into roadbumps along the way  



### Thursday, Oct 27
- Icebreaker/biology review!
- Evolution big picture stuff  
- Candy bar activity BECAUSE HALLOWEEN!  

#### Icebreaker
Introduce yourself again. In pairs, match each of the biology terms to its definition. First team to match them all correctly wins!

#### Evolution big picture: See slides
Then candy bar activity!
