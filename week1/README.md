# genetics-curriculum/week1
Week 1: Intros, Expectations, goals for the year, & evolution big picture stuff  

### Tuesday, Oct 25
- Intros again  (5 min)
- Icebreaker  (10 min)
- Lab tour!  (45 min)
- Expectations and goals for the year  (30 min)
- Discussion: What is research?  (30 min)

#### Expectations and goals for the year
- Individual activity: On a piece of paper, I want you to write down a) one goal you have for these internships b) one academic goal (school or class related) and c) one personal goal you have for this school year. 
- Now until Dec: Reviewing biology, reviewing Python, learning computational biology techniques and bioinformatics. A lot of this involves ALGORITHMS. We will also work on getting the data and cleaning up the data in a way that we can start to analyze it by January
- Jan thru May: We will start work on the research project.  

##### Expectations:
  * Attendance: 3 excused and 3 unexcused. Email me beforehand. Share email/phone #
  * Check your email at least twice a week!
  * Treat each other with respect  
  * Participation from everyone!

##### Goals: 
  * By the end of the year, you will all understand the motivation behind the research, what the main questions are and how the code you are writing helps address those questions.
  * You will be comfortable explaining what you did to an audience of both scientists (such as myself or Frank), as well as an audience of people with no science background.
  * You will understand how your programming skills can be applied to biology and to research.  


#### Discussion: What is research and how is it different from a class at school?  
- "Wet lab" vs "Dry lab"
- It is a process, can be slow at times, can change unexpectedly. FLEXIBILITY is so important.
- You WILL run into roadbumps along the way  



### Thursday, Oct 27
- Icebreaker/biology review! (30 min)
- Evolution big picture stuff  (30 min)
- Candy bar activity BECAUSE HALLOWEEN! (1 hr)  
- If extra time, go around museum as well

#### Icebreaker
Introduce yourself again. In pairs, match each of the biology terms to its definition. First team to match them all correctly wins!  
Terms: Prokaryote, Eukaryote, Nucleus, Mitochondria, DNA, RNA, Nucleotide, Protein, Transcription, Translation, Mitosis, Meiosis, etc.  
Lead into discussion about everyone's background in biology.

#### Evolution big picture: See slides.
Questions to ask: How old is the earth? How old is the earliest life on earth? What did early forms of life look like? How old are the dinosaurs? How old are humans? Build a timeline.  
- Origin of the earth
- Origin of the first life forms (single celled!)
- The three kingdoms: Eukarya, Archaea, Bacteria (Bonus: What is the difference between prokaryote and eukaryote?)
- Origin of multicellular life
- Origin of animals
- Cambrian Explosion, Dinosaurs
- Humans

How is all of the life on earth today related? How do we know this??   
- Fossil record
- Other geological/geochemical evidence
- DNA!!!

Why can knowing about evolution help us today? What is the motivation for this entire field of research?
- Biodiversity - preserve animals/plants and prevent them from going extinct
- What if you don't care about animals? Preventing human disease: SIV/HIV
- Learning about human origins and genetic ancestry
- Medicine: Understanding how bacteria and viruses evolve (very rapidly) can help us develop more efficient drugs

Then candy bar activity!
